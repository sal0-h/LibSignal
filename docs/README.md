# LibSignal Documentation

Deep-dive documentation for this fork. For install and a quick start, see the
top-level [`README.md`](../README.md); for the Cursor-Cloud agent environment, see
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

> **Scope reminder:** this fork is developed and tested on **SUMO** (`--world sumo`).
> CityFlow / OpenEngine code paths exist from upstream but are **not tested here**.
